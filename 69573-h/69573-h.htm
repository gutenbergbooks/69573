<span class="smcap">Education</span> <em>is dressed in classic robes, hair in
loose Grecian knot with gold fillet. She carries a
lamp shaped like the old-fashioned one so frequently
used to illustrate Education.</em></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Any City</span> <em>is studying the proposed tax levy for the
year. He is seated in an easy chair.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Any City</span> (<em>impatiently</em>). H’m. It just can’t be done!
It is out of the question to raise so much money by taxation
this year. This list of appropriations must be cut.
But where? What can be cut without raising a row?
(<em>Looks over the list.</em>) Half a million dollars for a new
bridge over the canal at 7th St. There’s a perfectly
good bridge at 9th St., and another at 3rd St. But the
railroad and marketmen will strike if we don’t build
this new bridge. To keep peace, I’ll have to stand by
that appropriation. (<em>Pointing to different items on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
paper.</em>) That must not be cut; nor that; nor that; nor
that! H’m! Three million dollars for the extension
of Grand View Avenue. Really, that’s not necessary.
That road is being opened only for the accommodation
of some rich men who take advantage of my city opportunities,
but live in the suburbs and evade paying any
taxes to me. But their financial influence is so great, I
dare not cut this appropriation. (<em>Continues study of
list.</em>) No, not that; nor that; nor that! Ha! here is the
school appropriation: three and a half million dollars. I
hate to do it, but I’ll have to cut here. Of course, it
means curtailing the kindergarten, deferring the building
of the much needed new elementary school in the 3rd
Ward, the abolition of summer schools, the serious
handicapping of junior and senior high school work, the
overcrowding of classes, and no hope of increase in
teachers’ salaries. Oh! I hate to do it! But I must! It’s
positively the only place I can cut without bringing
about a strike or at least a kick. But—oh—Taxation
is Vexation!</p>

borne many names. Men have called me Experience,
Tradition, Discipline, Invention, Culture, Ambition,
Knowledge, Training, Learning, Teaching, Instruction,
Development, Information, and many other names,
and I answer to all. But I am more commonly called
Education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> Why are you here?</p>

moment.</p>

many monkeys in the neighboring trees, not one fruit on
the small tree had been bitten or plucked. On our way
home I ran ahead of my brother. Suddenly he cried
aloud. I hastened back and found him lying on the
ground in great pain. He told me that he had eaten
some of the fruit and suffered greatly. I ran to the brook
for water, but he could not drink it. Then I called you.</p>

grain between two flat stones. Above them hangs

humming a monotonous tune. Gradually one of the
maidens stops and gazes dreamily toward the light.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Woman.</span> Get thee to thy work, maiden. Thinkst
thou idle fingers and dreaming eyes will grind the corn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maiden</span> (<em>with hand on upper stone as if ready to
resume work, but with eyes toward the light, which glows
brighter as she speaks</em>). I was but wondering if there be
not some better way to grind the corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Woman.</span> Better way to grind the corn, she says!
She means easier way—an easier way for her own idle
self! Shame upon thee, thou lazy maiden! Shame upon
thee, thou presumptuous maiden! Thinkst thou that
in thy foolish mind lies the wisdom of the earth? Had
there been a better way, would not our fathers, the wise
men of the land, have discovered that way and handed
it down to us? Have not the women of our country from
generation to generation ground their corn in this way?
If this way were good enough for them, it is good enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
for us! Thinkst thou that thou art better or wiser than
they? I have no patience with thy dreams, born of thine
own laziness! Get to work, maiden, and let me hear no
more of thy better ways! Better ways, forsooth!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hang"><em>While the</em> <span class="smcap">Old Woman</span> <em>speaks, the light burns dimmer.
The other maidens stop their work to listen,
all showing their approval of her words, and their
condemnation of her who dared to dream of better
things. As the</em> <span class="smcap">Old Woman</span> <em>finishes, they resume

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> Good for the Old Woman! I believe in
sticking to old well-tried things. So many people believe
that just because a thing is new, it is the only good
thing in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education.</span> But a greater number believe that just
because a thing is old, it is sacredly all sufficient. If
everybody had thought with you and the Old Woman,
how would the world be fed to-day? Think you those
primitive stone-grinders rival the great flour mills of the
present day? How many hand-mills think you would be
necessary to grind the wheat of our vast plains?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> Of course, I don’t mean that I want
things as they were long ago. But there are some people
who are never satisfied. They are continually wanting
things different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education.</span> No, you don’t want things to remain as
they <em>were</em>. You want them to stay as they <em>are</em>. That is
all the Old Woman wanted in her time. She didn’t
want to go back to the earliest days when the grain was
ground only by the teeth of the consumer. Had everyone
followed blindly the tradition of his own time, we
should still be at the very beginning. Look you to the
justly dissatisfied man for all that has made for progress
in the world. Saw you not how my light brightened at
the words of the maiden? Remember that, far as we
have journeyed in the past, so far and perhaps still farther
lies the way of the future along the Highway of
Progress. <em>Be not you bound too tightly by the bonds of old
tradition.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education.</span> An exact picture of Dame Weary’s
school in Colonial days. And you have not seen half
the tortures inflicted on her hapless pupils as recorded in
authentic records. When force rules, a despot reigns,
and a despot can beget naught but despotism. The
strong bullies; the sly escapes; the unscrupulous gathers
the spoils. There is no foundation laid for a true brotherhood
of man. In short, there is nothing in the teaching
or in the discipline in a school of force that fitly trains
pupils as present and future citizens of a democracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> No, not in the school you have just shown
me. But what of the little red schoolhouses? There we
had true training. The pupils were not helped over-much.

<p><span class="smcap">Education.</span> All honor to the splendid men and
women, teachers in the little red schoolhouses of the
past! Far be it from me to decry in any way their work.
But, methinks, the ruddy glow of the exterior and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
mellowing influence of time have thrown a warm glow
over the cold hard facts concerning the work that was
carried on in the interior of these buildings. And, even
if the little red schoolhouse was all that fancy has painted
it, it has served its time; it is as inadequate to the
work of training the boys and girls of to-day as are the
primitive stones to the task of grinding wheat for the
people of America in the twentieth century. You say
that the little red schoolhouse turned out patriots. The
first of these schools were built by English-speaking
people who sought civil, religious, and educational freedom.
They built their fort, their meeting-house, and
their school at the same time. I tell you, the little red
schoolhouse <em>received</em> patriots, patriots bred in democratic
principles. Our schools to-day receive people speaking
many languages, bred in ideals far removed from
those of a republic. When you speak of the schools of
the past, you think of the best; when you speak of the
schools of to-day, you speak as if you knew only the
worst. How long is it since you actually visited a real
American public school?</p>

<p class="center noindent">ADDRESS AT THE DEDICATION OF THE GETTYSBURG NATIONAL CEMETERY</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal.</p>

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that
war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a
final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.</p>

<p>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot
consecrate—we cannot hallow—this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated
it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it
can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which
they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us—that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve
that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and
that government of the people, by the people, for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher.</span> Stop quarrelin’. Fred is right. Now,
Fred, what can you tell me about Lincoln?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> He was a poor boy and split rails for the railroad.
He was president. He was shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> I know something else about Lincoln. He—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher</span> (<em>interrupting</em>). Never mind; we have no
time to hear more about him. Tell me what you know
about Franklin instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> One day a girl saw him walking along the
street eating a roll. She laughed at him and so she
married him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrie.</span> Franklin wrote wise things. We have a
book about him at home. He said, “Early to bed, and
early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Call that wise! Gee, I never go to bed before
eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> I don’t believe Franklin ever said that. It
don’t say anything like that in our history book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher.</span> Well, if it don’t we’ll not talk about it.
The land knows I’d be tickled if I had time to hear all
that your book says, without huntin’ up more trouble
in other books. Now we must stop. Time’s up, but you
have done splendid, children. Nobody can say I don’t
teach my children American history as good as anybody,

<p class="right noindent"><span class="smcap">Education</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Any City</span> <em>appear before the curtain</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> But it is impossible that such a state of
affairs can ever exist in this land!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education.</span> Impossible! I tell you the beginning of
such a state of affairs exists in this land to-day. The
danger is even now at your doors. When the penurious,
short-sighted policy of the public drives the cultured,
trained, and efficient teacher from the classroom, her
place is taken by the ignorant, the untrained, or the inefficient.
There are scores of thousands of untrained,
inefficient teachers in American schools, teaching American
children to-day; and, unless the public speedily
awakes to the danger, and pays the price for competent
service, such teachers will predominate in the schools of
to-morrow. Unless measures are promptly taken to secure
for every child in America a seat in a healthful
schoolroom, and books and materials for his education,
the public schools of the land will surely sink to the level
of the classroom I have just shown you. Are you willing
to trust the government of this country to citizens so
trained?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> But the children you showed me are the
children of the poor, the ignorant. Surely the children
of the rich, the cultured, will have better training.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education</span> (<em>sternly</em>). The children I showed you
are the children of America; and would you train a
selected few to rule this land? If you say <em>yes</em>, then are
you a traitor to America. You would overthrow this
Democracy—the “government of the people, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
people, and for the people,” and substitute an aristocracy—a
government of the people, by a favored
class, for—what? Nay! I tell you, “the end of American
education is the knowledge and the practice of Democracy.”
The education of the children in a democracy
is the concern of all the public. It must be an education
of all the people, paid for by all the people. You sent
millions of Americans across the sea to make the world
safe for Democracy. You must educate every child in
the land to make democracy safe for America. “Education
is the most sacred concern, and the only hope of
a nation.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Any City.</span> You are right. I wish that you had shown
me a happier view of the future, however.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education</span> (<em>eagerly</em>). I will. I will show you my
dream for the future education of America, and I can
make the dream come true if you will lend your aid.
Come.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
